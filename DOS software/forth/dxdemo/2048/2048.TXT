2048

A 2D sliding block puzzle game where blocks with numbers are combined
to add their values.

The rules are that at each turn the player must perform a valid move
shifting all tiles in one direction (up, down, left or right).  A move
is valid when at least one tile can be moved in that direction.  When
a tile is moved against other tiles with the same number they combine
into one.  A new tile with a value 2 (occasionally 4) is spawned at
the end of each turn if there is an empty spot for it.  To win the
player must create a tile with the number 2048.  The player loses if
no valid moves are possible.

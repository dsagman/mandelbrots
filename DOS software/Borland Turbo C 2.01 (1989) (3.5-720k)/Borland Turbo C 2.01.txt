Turbo C is an Integrated Development Environment and compiler for the
C programming language from Borland. First introduced in 1987, it was
noted for its integrated development environment, small size, fast
compile speed, comprehensive manuals and low price. After 2.0 this
product was replaced with Borland Turbo C++. It competed against,
Microsoft Quick C and was generally considered faster and more
successful.

Turbo C 2.0 adds an integrated debugger.

Turbo C 2.x was the last release under the "Turbo C" name. It was
replaced by Turbo C++ 1.0, which supported both C and C++.

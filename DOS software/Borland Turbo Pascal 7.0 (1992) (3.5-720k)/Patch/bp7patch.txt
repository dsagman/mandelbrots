Patching Turbo Pascal
The Problem:
Turbo Pascal v.7 for DOS programs which contain the code

uses
   CRT

may freeze up or produce a "Divide by zero" error on machines with speeds 
greater than about 200 Mhz. This error occurs when the CRT unit attempts to 
measure the speed of the machine. In order to measure the speed, it runs a 
timing loop and then does some division to produce an average speed. On very 
fast machines, this average ends up being a number larger than the program 
(in its current form) can store. For technical reasons, this generates a 
divide by zero error.

The Cure:
You must fix your version of Turbo Pascal by applying a patch.

   1. Download the bp7patch.exe patch file into the Turbo Pascal v.7 \bin 
      folder for your machine (the folder will have a name such as C:\Borland\turbo7\bin).
   2. Go to a DOS prompt, and change to the Turbo Pascal v.7 \bin folder.
   3. Determine the minor version number of your version of Turbo Pascal by 
      looking at the creation time for the TURBO.TPL file. The command 
      DIR TURBO.TPL will display this. The result will be one of

          TURBO.TPL  48,432  10-27-92  7:00a
          TURBO.TPL  48,464  03-09-93  7:01a 

      depending on whether you have version 7.00 or 7.01.
   4. Backup your program files in case of catastrophic error:

          MKDIR BACKUP
          COPY T*.* BACKUP

   5. Uncompress the archive (this is a self-extracting archive file):

          BP7PATCH

   6. Install the patch:

          PATCH PATCHxxx

      where xxx is replaced with 700 or 701, depending on the minor version 
      number of your software.

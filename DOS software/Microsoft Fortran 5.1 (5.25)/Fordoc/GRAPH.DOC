Additional Graphics Routines
----------------------------

    Two routines have been added to the graphics library.

    ScrollTextWindow (lines)
    ------------------------

    The ScrollTextWindow subroutine scrolls text within the defined text
    window. Any text or graphics outside the window is unaffected.
    ScrollTextWindow takes a single integer argument which equals the number
    of lines to be scrolled. Positive values scroll the screen up; negative
    values scroll the screen down.

    GetTextWindow (r1, c1, r2, c2)
    ------------------------------

    The GetTextWindow subroutine takes four integer arguments, which return
    the upper-left-hand and lower-right-hand corner boundaries of the current
    text window (as established by SetTextWindow). The first two are the row
    and column of the upper-left-hand corner. The second two are the row
    and column of the lower-right-hand corner.


Proper Use of Include Files with IMPLICIT NONE
----------------------------------------------

    If you use both IMPLICIT NONE and INCLUDE 'FGRAPH.FI', the correct order
    is

        INCLUDE 'FGRAPH.FI'
        IMPLICIT NONE

    Here is a sample file with two subroutines and a main program. (The
    PROGRAM Main statement is still optional but using it if you also use
    IMPLICIT NONE is clearer.) Note that INCLUDE 'FGRAPH.FI' appears once
    per file, while INCLUDE 'FGRAPH.FD' appears once in each routine.

        INCLUDE 'FGRAPH.FI'
        PROGRAM  Main
        IMPLICIT NONE
        INCLUDE 'FGRAPH.FD'
           .
           .
           .
        END


        SUBROUTINE  One
        IMPLICIT NONE
        INCLUDE 'FGRAPH.FD'
           .
           .
           .
        END


        SUBROUTINE  Two
        IMPLICIT NONE
        INCLUDE 'FGRAPH.FD'
           .
           .
           .
        END
